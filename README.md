# HackBusters-Lincoln-Hack-2018
Hack for Lincoln Hack 2018, using Node.js and Socket.IO to make a Lincoln themed game playable across multiple phone screens in a row.

This was my entry for Lincoln Hack 2018, the challenge I entered was to create something "Lincoln related". 

I chose to do create game where the user controls a plane in the 617 Squadron involved in The Dambuster's Raid. 617 were a squadron based at RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire.

The game is a flying game that can be played across multiple phone screens set out in a row. 

Built using Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, LESS, JQuery.

It won me 24 cans of Red Bull!
